# Crowdference Browser Extension

https://crowdference.org is a site that allows share custom links between any two web pages. This plugin make it easy to view what pages are custom-linked with the page on the current tab, and to link it with any page on the other tabs.

## Description
Have you ever miss some links in any web page?
Would you like to complete the usability of a website linking it with some other webs that add more information about the topic?
Don't be great to link the fakenews pages with those links who clarify the information?

I do, and that's the reason I have created crowdference, the website and the pluging.

I hope you enjoy it, and feel free to give me feedback or help me with the code.
